			<p class="page-txt-a mt-20">
				NMSC has conducted inter-calibration for calibrating MI infrared channels which is based on the GSICS (Global Space-based Inter-Calibration System) Coordinate Center
				(GCC) Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD). The hyperspectral Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) and Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) on
				the low Earth orbit satellite are used as reference instrument.<br><br>
				For visible channels calibration, NMSC performs the vicarious calibration method by using earth target(ocean, desert, WC(Water Cloud) and DCC(Deep Convective Cloud))
				and GEO-LEO inter-calibration methods ray-matching and GSICS DCC.

			<p class="page-txt-a mt-20">
				GK2A(Geo-Kompsat-2A) AMI (Advanced Meteorological Imager) has 10 infrared channels and its radiometric calibration is conducted in stage of Level 1A data processing
				by measuring the radiances of warm and cold targets, blackbody onboard GK2A and space-look, respectively. In addition to onboard calibration, NMSC has examined the
				inter-calibration as a part of GSICS (Global Space-based Inter-Calibration System) activities. It is helpful to check the quality of operational measurements for GK2A and
				sensor degradation with time. GSICS inter-calibration system is to compare two observation values measured by an instrument. We want to calibrate and reference
				instrument which is known as relatively accurate.

			<p class="page-txt-a mt-20">
				NMSC/KMA has performed inter-calibration between AMI(Advanced Meteorogical Imagers on GK2A satellites and high-spectral-resolution sounders on LEO satellites.
				Data from IASI(Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometers) on Metop–B and -C satellites, CrIS(Cross_track Infrared Sounder) on SNPP and NOAA20 satellite are used
				for this inter-calibration. The infrared inter-calibration results are generated once a day.

			<h3 class="sub-title mt-80">Algorithm</h3>
			<p class="page-txt-a mt-20">
				The inter-calibration system for GK2A infrared channels is thoroughly based on the GSICS Coordinate Center (GCC) Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD). In order
				to conduct calibration system, first we should make collocation dataset for measured pixels of GK2A and LEOs. The FOV(field of view) of the hyper-spectral sounders is
				about 12 km diameter at nadir and that of AMI infrared channels are 2 km. The sounder radiance is compared with an average value for AHI radiances over a dimension of
				7 × 7 pixels (FOV box) corresponding to the sounder FOV. Then, the several channel measurements of hyper-spectral sounder is converted into a simulated radiance
				according to spectral response function (SRF) of GK2A. It is called as constraint method, generating a super channel consisting of combination of a lot of channels to imitate
				a broadband channel. More details of the methods for collocation and spectral simulation are given in below paragraph.
